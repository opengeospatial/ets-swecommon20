# OM 2.0 Release Notes

## 1.0 
  * First release - all the conformance classes.
  * [#1](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-om20/issues/1) Cannot validate schema-aware schematron files
    * Due to SAXON license problem, we can't use SAXON to validate schema-aware schematrons. Instead of using the schema-element function in schematron files, we wrote our own schema-element feature to make it work.

## 1.1
  * [#2](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-om20/issues/2) Release notes are missing on project website
  * Add conformance class configuration in config.xml
